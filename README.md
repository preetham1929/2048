2048 is a popular online game I tried to replicate the game by using c++ you can play this game by pasting the 2048.cpp in the GDB online debugger(https://www.onlinegdb.com/) or any other code editor of your choice and run the code .
In case you want to play the orginal version https://2048game.com
